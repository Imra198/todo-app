A dynamic task management web app built with vanilla JavaScript that allows users to add, complete, and remove tasks with interactive UI styling.

## 🚀 Features

- Mark tasks as completed
- Remove tasks
- Press Enter to add tasks
- Clean flexbox layout

## Technologies Used

- CSS3 (Flexbox)
- Vanilla JavaScript (DOM Manipulation)

## Project Structure
project-folder/

├── index.html
├── style.css
├── script.js
└── README.md

## How It Works
- Tasks are dynamically created using JavaScript
- Each task includes:
  - A checkbox
  - Task text
  - Remove button
- Completed tasks toggle a `.completed` class

## Future Improvements
- LocalStorage support

- Task filtering (All / Completed / Active)
